# Hashtables

## Introduction
In order to store information efficiently, it is important to structure it in a way that makes the data easily re-accessible. When we have a two-pair tuple where the first index is a key and the second index is the information, similar to a dictionary, we need a way to efficiently store a large number of tuples in order to re-access them at a later time. Rather than placing all these tuples into a list and searching through them linearly, hashtables allow us to map keys to specific bins where we can store these tuples. This exponentially increases our search efficiency and allows us to find information much more quickly at the expense of additional setup time.

Think of it as a Marie-Kondo-approved method of organization, where you have a set of bins with different labels -- computer games, lego, books. For Mario Kart, you would put it in computer games, your LEGO airport shuttle model would be put it in the bin labeled legos and finally, your collection of Harry Potter books would be put in the bin labeled books. This might take some time to set up, but because you have organized them into well-defined storage boxes, you will be able to look for your item very quickly as compared to searching sequentially through a big box of items where you might have to look through every single item before you find the lego piece.
